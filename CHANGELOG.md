# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for published releases (npm `package.json` and Tauri `tauri.conf.json`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Keep a Changelog–style `CHANGELOG.md`; GitHub Releases use the matching version section as the release description.

### Changed

- CI desktop builds are **macOS only** (Apple silicon and Intel); Linux and Windows release jobs removed for now.
- GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout` v6, `actions/setup-node` v6, `actions/cache` v5 (Node 24–ready action runtimes).
- Cursor rule `changelog.mdc`: document updating `## [Unreleased]` when committing directly on `main`.

### Fixed

- **Desktop:** `DockBtn` supports a `title` attribute (fixes TypeScript build for Tauri `beforeBuildCommand`).
- **Tooling:** portable pnpm via root `.npmrc` (`store-dir=.pnpm-store`); removed committed machine-specific `pnpm-workspace.yaml` store path that broke CI.
- **CI:** install pnpm with Corepack (no `pnpm/action-setup` / `packageManager` clash); run `actions/cache` after Corepack so `pnpm store path` works; `tauri-action` input `includeUpdaterJson` replaces deprecated `uploadUpdaterJson`.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Initial alpha: interactive knowledge graph (web + Tauri v2); desktop installers on GitHub Releases (macOS Apple silicon and Intel).
